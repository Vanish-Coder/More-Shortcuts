# More Shortcuts

A Chrome extension that adds keyboard shortcuts Chrome doesn't have by default.

## Shortcuts
Mac Sh.   Windows Sh.      ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Description

| `⌘⇧H` | `Ctrl+Shift+H` | Collapse the active tab's group + pause any playing media.|

| `⌘⇧G` | `Ctrl+Shift+G` | Open a new tab and place it in its own new group.|

| `⌘⇧Y` | `Ctrl+Shift+Y` | Open a random site from your custom list.|


### How to set up the shortcuts?

Chrome reserves some shortcuts at the OS level, so extensions can't claim it automatically. Also, you have to set all shortcuts manually as of now.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the correct folder.

## Popup
Click the extension icon to open the popup. From there you can:
- Toggle each shortcut on or off.
- Manage the list of sites for the Random Site Launcher (add/remove URLs).

## Notes
- The **Collapse Group** shortcut only works if the active tab belongs to a tab group. If it doesn't, only media pausing runs.
- The **New Tab in Group** shortcut creates a new group for every new tab — rename/recolor the group in Chrome's tab bar as usual.
- Sites added to the Random Site Launcher are synced across your Chrome profile via chrome.storage.sync.
